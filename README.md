📘 Notebook 1 – Model similarity check

Multiple AI models are tested.

Their outputs are compared to see how similar they are (correlation).

Goal: Choose models that behave differently, so when combined, they reduce risk and improve performance.

👉 Think: Don’t put all money on strategies that think the same way.

📘 Notebook 2 – Best data parameters

Tests different time intervals and look-back periods (how much past data the model sees).

Compares returns for each combination.

Finds which data settings give best performance.

👉 Example:
Should the model look at last 10 days or 50 days?
Should data be daily or weekly?

📘 Notebook 3 – Best model parameters

Now focuses on model settings, not data.

Tries different AI parameters.

Scores each model by average returns.

Picks the best performing configuration.

👉 Example:
Which learning rate, depth, or model setup works best?
